Adult income project  contains dataset that is analyzed using different functions 

I'm excited to share my latest data analysis project focused on the Adult Income dataset, where I applied key Excel functions like COUNTIF, SUMIF, SWITCH, and VLOOKUP to derive insightful answers to business questions.

The dataset contains various demographic and financial details, including age, workclass, ID, education, marital status, occupation, race, and capital gain. One of the key analyses I conducted was identifying the workclass associated with a specific capital gain of 7698. Using the VLOOKUP function, I could search through the dataset to find the corresponding workclass of adults with this exact capital gain. This method allowed me to streamline the lookup process and generate fast insights.

In another analysis, I utilized the SWITCH function to show different educational messages based on workclass categories. For instance, if an individual worked in a "Local Government" position, it displayed that the education is free. Conversely, for other workclasses, the function returned that the education had a high fee. This dynamic approach helped me handle conditional text-based outcomes easily and effectively.

Additionally, I calculated the total value of capital gain for individuals with a workclass categorized as "Private." The SUMIF function enabled me to filter out only those records belonging to the private sector, summing up their respective capital gains. This simple but powerful function facilitated quick aggregation without needing to sort or filter the data manually.

Lastly, using COUNTIF, I explored how many individuals belonged to the "Local Government" workclass. By counting the IDs associated with this category, I quickly determined the total number of people working in this sector, offering valuable workforce distribution insights.

This project was a great opportunity to sharpen my data analysis skills using Excel functions, especially in terms of categorization, conditional logic, and data aggregation. Analyzing this dataset helped me uncover significant insights about the income distribution across various workclasses, demonstrating the power of using the right tools to extract actionable information from raw data.
